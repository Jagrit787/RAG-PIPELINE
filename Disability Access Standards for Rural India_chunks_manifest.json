Previously, the detailed technical \nspecifications issued by the DDWS existed primarily as policy guidelines. By inserting the \nspecific notification numbers of the DDWS documents into the core RPwD Rules, the \ngovernment has made these granular technical specifications (such as the maximum ramp \nslope of 1:15, or the precise placement of handrails) subject to the legal accountability \n\n\nprovisions of the RPwD Act.1 This elevation ensures that implementing bodies, from Central \nagencies to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), must achieve compliance with these technical \nrequirements, transforming adherence from voluntary best practice into a statutory \nobligation. \nThe specific insertions into Rule 15(1) are summarized below: \nStatutory Amendments to RPwD Rules, 2017 (Rule 15(1)) \n \nNew Clause \nReference \nNotification",

Statutory Inclusion of DDWS Accessibility Standards \n \nThe insertion of clauses (i) and (j) officially incorporates the technical standards finalized by \nthe Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) under the Ministry of Jal Shakti.1 \nThis legislative action creates a strong link between accessibility mandates and two flagship \nnational programs: the provision of Piped Water Supply (PWS), often delivered through the Jal \nJeevan Mission (JJM), and the development of Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs) under \nthe Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase II.1 \n\n\n \nIII. Guidelines on Accessible and Inclusive Piped Water \nSupply (Notification \nCDN-11017/58/2021-Coordination-DDWS) \n \nThe Guidelines on accessible and inclusive piped water supply aim to provide comprehensive \ninformation for designing PWS infrastructure that is usable at the household, community, and \ninstitutional levels.1 The document draws upon established benchmarks, including the \nHandbook on Barrier Free and Accessibility from the Central Public Works Department \n(CPWD), the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) Harmonised Guidelines (2021), \nthe National Building Code (NBC), and International Standard ISO 21542: 2011.1 \n \nA. Universal Design Philosophy and Scope \n \nThe core objective of these guidelines is to ensure PWS facilities are accessible for persons \nwith disabilities and other population groups facing access challenges.1 This approach goes \nbeyond the 21 categories of disabilities defined in the RPwD Act. The scope explicitly includes \nindividuals with temporary access challenges, such as \npregnant women, mothers with young children, or persons suffering from short-term \nphysical ailments.1 By formally recognizing that access limitations can be situational and \ntemporary (e.g., due to injury or pregnancy), the mandate promotes Universal Design \nprinciples, ensuring the design benefits the widest possible population and guarantees dignity \nfor every user at all times.1 \nThe document identifies major disabilities that currently form barriers to accessing piped \nwater, including blindness, low-vision, locomotor disability, dwarfism, cerebral palsy, muscular \ndystrophy, chronic neurological conditions, Parkinson's disease, and multiple disabilities.1 \n \nB. Functional Requirements of an Accessible PWS Facility \n \nThe guidelines strictly define an accessible piped drinking water facility based on four \n\n\nmandatory functional criteria 1: \nFunctional Requirements Defining an Accessible PWS Facility \nRequirement Category \nCriterion for Accessibility",

Residential complexes must \nprovide at least one accessible drinking water point per floor in dormitory, staff, and \nvisitor areas.1 Health centers (PHC, CHC, hospitals) must provide at least one accessible \npoint per ward (male, female, pediatric).1 \n \nIV. Accessibility Standards for Community Toilets in \nRural Areas (Notification S-18012/5/2021-SBM-DDWS) \n \nThese standards focus on ensuring that Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs)—a key \nelement of rural sanitation—are fully inclusive.1 Recognizing the operational realities of rural \ninfrastructure, the document advises against complex technology-intensive solutions, such as \nsensor-based doors or dustbins, due to their high capital costs and the difficulty of ensuring \nregular O&M in community-operated rural areas.1 The focus is placed instead on reliable, \nlow-tech hardware and precise dimensional compliance. A. Design Solutions by Disability Type \n \nThe design solutions are categorized by the difficulties they address 1: \n●​ Physical Disability/Mobility Impairments: Require smooth, barrier-free paths; ramps \nwith adequate slope; non-slippery floors; adequate maneuvering space within the \ncubicle; raised seats; and specific grab bars.1 \n●​ Vision Impairment: Requires guide strings along the path, well-illuminated areas, and \n\n\nsufficient color/tonal contrast between walls, floors, and fixtures.1 \n●​ Speech and Hearing Impairment: Requires the use of proper, clear signage that \nincludes both symbols and text (using a bold, 18 pt font) placed at a height of 1500 mm \nto 1800 mm from the ground.1 \n \nB. External Access and Pathway Compliance \n \nStringent adherence to dimensional specifications for access routes is required for external \ncompliance 1: \n●​ Access Pathway: Must be clear, smooth, and free of obstacles, constructed of antiskid \nfloor material, and using tactile tile fixing as specified. The pathway must maintain a \nminimum clear width of 1200 mm.1 \n●​ Ramp Slope and Landing: The entrance must include a ramp with a moderate slope, \nspecifically set at a maximum gradient of 1:15 (one unit vertical rise for every 15 units \nhorizontal run). The landing area before the ramp must provide at least \n1200 mm×1200 mm of clear space.1 \n●​ Dual Handrails: Ramps must be equipped with continuous handrails on both sides at \ntwo levels: the lower rail fixed at 700 mm to 750 mm height, and the upper rail fixed at \n850 mm to 900 mm height from the finished floor. The ends must be rounded, grouted, \nand extend 300 mm beyond the ramp ends.1 \n●​ Corridor Width: Inside the building, corridors must maintain a minimum clear passage \nwidth of 1200 mm to accommodate wheelchair access.1 \n●​ Steps: Accessible steps must have a uniform riser (maximum 150 mm) and tread \n(minimum 300 mm) with an unobstructed width of at least 1200 mm. They must also have \ncontinuous two-level handrails mirroring the ramp specifications.1 \n \nC. Accessible Toilet Cubicle Specifications \n \nThe accessible cubicle is central to the CSC design and features precise requirements to \nensure safe transfer and maneuvering.1 \n●​ Internal Dimensions: The inner space should preferably be 1.80 m×2.00 m. Crucially, \nthere must be a clear space of 1200 mm in front of the Water Closet (WC) to allow for \neasy circular movement of a wheelchair.1 \n●​ Door Specifications: The door must have a 900 mm clear width and must open \noutward for safety and convenience, although a sliding door is also advisable.",

The \n\n\nhandle must be D-shaped and mounted horizontally at 850 mm to 1000 mm from the \nfloor.1 \n●​ WC Type and Height: The WC must be of European style (Commode), wall-mounted, \nand installed precisely at 0.48 meters above the floor level. This specific height is \nmandated to align with standard wheelchair seat heights, thereby facilitating safer and \nmore dignified transfer.1 An alarm bell must also be included for emergency purposes.1 \n●​ Grab Bar Configuration: The placement of grab bars is detailed to support transfer \nmaneuvers. An L-shaped grab bar (700 mm×700 mm) must be mounted at 0.7 meters \nhigh on the wall side. A U-shaped grab bar must be mounted at 480 mm high on the \ntransfer side.1 The dimensional precision of these bars is essential for the \nbiomechanically optimized movement of wheelchair users. In the rural context, GI pipe or \nstainless steel bars (25 mm to 35 mm diameter) fixed at 700 mm from the ground on both \nsides are acceptable alternatives.1 \n●​ Urinals: Urinal locations must be step-free. At least one urinal should be fixed at a lower \nheight and include grab bars on each side and in front to support ambulant persons, \nsuch as crutch users.1 \n \nD. Wash Basin and Sensory Requirements within the CSC \n \nWithin the CSC, wash basins and fixtures must also adhere to accessibility principles.1 \n●​ Wash Basin Height and Clearance: The wash basin top edge must be between 700 mm \nand 800 mm from the floor, providing a clear knee space of at least 760 mm wide by 200 \nmm deep and 650 mm to 680 mm high.1 The wash basin itself must contrast with the wall \ncolor.1 \n●​ Taps: Taps must be of the long lever type, preferably fixed at 0.7 to 0.8 meters from the \nfloor level.1 \n●​ Sensory Cues: Signage must be clearly visible, in contrasting colors, and supplemented \nwith Braille facility.1 Contrast color banding around the toilet door and on inner walls is \nrequired for low vision users, and fixtures must contrast with the inner wall color.1 \n \nV. Policy Implications, Implementation Challenges, and \nRecommendations \n \nThe amendments represent a critical legal mandate, merging social justice goals with \n\n\ninfrastructure development. However, implementation hinges on overcoming institutional and \nlogistical challenges inherent to decentralized rural governance. A. Institutional and Capacity Gaps \n \nThe detailed nature of the standards—such as the requirement for a 1:15 ramp gradient or the \nspecific heights for grab bars (0.7 m and 0.48 m)—necessitates a significant level of technical \nprecision.1 The document itself identifies existing systemic weaknesses, including the \nexclusion of persons with disabilities from the planning process, the lack of clear policy \nguidelines for accessible PWS, and a widespread absence of technical capacity and \nawareness materials (IEC) among key stakeholders, including PRIs and local service providers.1 \nAchieving full compliance requires that local government bodies and the technicians they \nemploy move beyond simple provision (e.g., \"a ramp is present\") to functional compliance \n(e.g., \"the ramp meets the 1:15 slope requirement, and the handrail is at the precise dual \nheight\").\nrvice providers.1 \nAchieving full compliance requires that local government bodies and the technicians they \nemploy move beyond simple provision (e.g., \"a ramp is present\") to functional compliance \n(e.g., \"the ramp meets the 1:15 slope requirement, and the handrail is at the precise dual \nheight\"). This implies a substantial disconnect between the high-level regulatory mandate and \nthe grassroots technical capability required to execute it.1 \n \nB.
