    "text": "2.1 Visual and Tactile Aids for Safe Navigation \n \n\n\nNavigating steps and changes in elevation is a significant safety challenge for individuals with \nvisual impairments. The standard addresses this through specific, prescriptive requirements \nfor visual cues. \nAccording to Clause 2.2.5.4 of AIS-052 (Rev. 1), steps must be designed \"...with all steps edges \ndesigned to minimise the risk of tripping and being in contrasting colour or colours. A yellow \ncolour band of 50 mm width shall be provided on all steps to assist visually impaired people\".1 \nThis clause employs a multi-faceted approach to enhance step visibility. It does not merely \nsuggest a general principle but mandates two distinct layers of visual aids. The requirement \nfor \"contrasting colour or colours\" serves as a general accessibility feature, helping individuals \nwith low vision to better differentiate the edge of a step from its surrounding surfaces. This \nimproves depth perception and reduces the risk of missteps. \nMore significantly, the standard prescribes a specific, high-visibility warning: \"A yellow colour \nband of 50 mm width.\" This is not an arbitrary choice. Yellow is one of the most luminous \ncolors in the visible spectrum and is universally recognized in safety and warning applications. \nIts high contrast against most common flooring materials makes it perceptible even in lower \nlight conditions or to individuals with certain types of color vision deficiency. By mandating \nthis specific feature, the standard creates a predictable and uniform safety language across \nthe national bus fleet, allowing visually impaired passengers to anticipate and recognize this \ncrucial visual cue. This shifts the responsibility for this fundamental accessibility feature from \nthe discretion of the transport operator to a mandatory requirement for the bus body builder, \nensuring it is an integral part of the vehicle's design and construction from inception.",

    "text": "2.2 Auditory and Visual Information Systems for Orientation and \nAwareness \n \nFor a visually impaired passenger, auditory information is the primary means of orientation \nand awareness during travel. AIS-052 mandates systems that provide this crucial information. \nClause 2.2.19.6 of AIS-052 (Rev. 1) stipulates that all Type I NDX (Non-Deluxe city) public \nservice buses \"shall be provided with Audio / Visual or Audio-Visual Information System \npermitting driver or recorded or digitised human speech / visual messages, to inform \npassengers inside the bus regarding the destination, bus stops etc.\".1 The provision of an \naudio system is vital for the independence of passengers who cannot read visual displays or \nidentify landmarks to determine their location. \nThe standard's specific requirement for \"recorded or digitised human speech\" demonstrates \na nuanced understanding of the practical challenges of auditory accessibility. In the often \n\n\nnoisy and chaotic environment of a public bus, a low-quality, robotic text-to-speech system \ncould be difficult to understand. Human speech, with its natural intonation and cadence, is \nmore robust and intelligible against background noise. This detail ensures that the information \nprovided is not just present but is effective and clear for those who rely on it completely. \nFurthermore, the standard creates a complete communication loop for passengers when \nrequesting a stop. Clause 2.2.19.5 requires that controls for requesting stops must have \n\"auditory and visual indications that the request has been made\".1 For a sighted passenger, a \nlight illuminates. For a visually impaired passenger, the mandated \"auditory indication\"—such \nas a distinct chime or a spoken \"stop requested\"—is the essential feedback mechanism. \nWithout this confirmation, the passenger would be left in a state of uncertainty, unsure if their \nrequest was registered. This requirement establishes a closed-loop system: the passenger \nacts (presses the button), and the system provides non-visual confirmation, building \nconfidence and reducing the anxiety associated with public transport.",

While not exclusive to the visually impaired, this \nguarantees access to strategically located seating, typically near the entrance, which \nminimizes the need for navigating the length of a potentially crowded bus. \nTo facilitate safe boarding and alighting, Clause 2.2.19.4 of AIS-052 (Rev. 1) specifies \nrequirements for handrails. It states that handrails at the entrance of Type I buses must be \nconfigured to \"allow persons with disabilities to grasp such assists from outside the vehicle \nwhile starting to board, and to continue using such assists throughout the boarding \nprocess...\".1 The emphasis on continuity is critical. It means the handrail system must be \ndesigned without gaps, allowing a person relying on tactile guidance and support to maintain \na secure and continuous hold from the ground, up the steps, and into the passenger area. \nThis transforms the handrail from a series of isolated components into an integrated \nnavigational and safety system, essential for maintaining balance and orientation.",

By locating the reserved berth on the lower tier \nand near the service door, the standard minimizes the travel distance within the vehicle and \neliminates the need for a visually impaired passenger to climb a ladder to an upper berth, a \ntask that would present significant safety risks. This demonstrates a coherent regulatory \nphilosophy that prioritizes minimizing internal navigation for passengers with disabilities \nacross different types of bus services.",

In a sleeper coach at night, when lights are dim and gangways may be \nobstructed, leaving the berth to locate the crew can be hazardous. The call bell directly \nmitigates this challenge by bringing the means of communication to the passenger.
