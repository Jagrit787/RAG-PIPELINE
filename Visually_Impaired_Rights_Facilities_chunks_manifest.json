    "text": "Rights, Facilities, and Challenges for \nVisually Impaired in India \nEducational Rights for Visually Impaired \n• \nAlthough Indian law guarantees education for all, blind children often face exclusion \nfrom mainstream schools. For instance, one family’s son Pradeep (born blind) was \nrepeatedly denied admission by regular schools (“teachers unable to cope,” fear of \nburdening other students), forcing his parents to send him to a special school for the \nblind. \n• \nAdvocates insist on inclusive education measures: e.g. one expert recommends that if \neven one blind pupil is in class, textbooks must be provided in Braille and trained aides \n(such as a Braille-trained assistant) must be available. In practice, teacher training and \nresources often lag behind. \n• \nNGOs support blind students’ learning. The Samrita Trust, for example, provides Braille-\nbased learning devices to visually impaired students from preschool through college, \nhelping them study independently and qualify for jobs. Such efforts aim to fill gaps left \nby official services. \nAssistive Technologies and Accessibility \n• \nScreen-reading technology can greatly empower blind people, but implementation is \nuneven. India has no formal “accessibility inspectors,” so many employers and public \noffices lack basic accommodations. In principle, screen readers and speech software \nenable visually impaired users to work as effectively as anyone, yet most organizations \nhave no standards to support them. \n• \nIn everyday life, blind individuals succeed with assistive tech. For example, a visually \nimpaired woman became a voice/accent trainer at a BPO by learning the JAWS software \n(which vocalizes on-screen text). She attended mainstream schools and college, then \nused screen-reader software to secure employment at IBM Daksh. \n• \nBraille literacy is critical. Experts stress providing exam materials and classroom text in \nBraille whenever a blind student is present. Despite this need, availability of Braille \nbooks and readers is limited: blind Indians themselves report that “unavailability of \nreaders and literature in Braille” is a top concern. \n• \nPublic facilities are gradually becoming more accessible. For instance, a national \nresearch library installed ramps, accessible toilets, and computers equipped for visually \nimpaired users, enabling blind scholars to work there independently. Such \ninfrastructure shows progress in accommodating the blind in educational and public \ninstitutions. \n\n\nEmployment and Economic Rights \n• \nThe Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 1995 reserves 3% of government jobs for \ndisabled persons, including a 1% share specifically for the visually impaired. The Act \neven extended job quotas to higher-level positions (A & B categories) that were \npreviously excluded. This has allowed some blind individuals to enter elite services (e.g. \nIAS officers) that were once inaccessible. \n• \nIn practice, implementation remains spotty. One report notes that although the quota \nscheme was simplified and enabled blind candidates to clear prestigious exams, \ndisabled applicants still face hurdles and must repeatedly prove their eligibility. \nReservation rules also exclude many impairment groups, but sighted-blindness is \nexplicitly covered (1% in most disability schemes). \n• \nFinancial assistance varies by disability. For example, the state of Haryana historically \ngave larger unemployment stipends to blind recipients (₹400–600) than to other \ngroups. Recent policy changes equalized allowances (a flat ₹1,000–2,000 for all \neducated disabled unemployed). Tax and benefit concessions often favor the blind: e.g. \nmiddle-class income-tax exemptions and housing/tuition rebates are granted to visually \nimpaired persons without the strict disability threshold others face. \n• \nDespite legal measures, overall employment rates for disabled (including visually \nimpaired) have remained low. A World Bank study found that by 2002 only ~38% of \ndisabled persons were employed (down from 42.7% in 1991), indicating that barriers \nto hiring and workplace inclusion persist despite policies. \nSocial Attitudes and Representation \n• \nIndian culture often stereotypes blindness as a fatal flaw. In mythology, for example, the \nblind prince Dhritarashtra was deemed unfit to rule, underscoring long-held beliefs that \n“loss of sight makes one incompetent.” Famous blind Indians like writer Ved Mehta have \nlamented that society views blindness as akin to begging or “fate reserved for beggars.” \nSuch attitudes contribute to widespread stigma and pity. \n• \nMisconceptions and patronizing behavior are common. One anecdote notes that people \nspeaking to a blind person instinctively raise their voice as if the person were also deaf. \nMore broadly, many assume the blind are non-sexual or incapable of normal life: young \nwomen with visual impairments report pressure and misunderstanding around \nmarriage and sexuality, and even fear of having children. (By contrast, blind girls like \nRadhika and Puja in Delhi vocally reject the idea of abortion – they argue disabled \nchildren deserve identity and life.) \n• \nMedia portrayal often misses real blind experiences. Films and TV frequently use able-\nbodied stars to depict disabled characters (“disability drag”), which keeps disability out \nof community view. This dramatization can misrepresent the challenges and capabilities \nof visually impaired people, reinforcing myths rather than showing authentic lives. \n• \nLanguage is changing, however: official and advocacy circles now prefer terms like \n“visually impaired” instead of outdated slurs or even “blind,” reflecting a shift toward \nrespectful identity. As one author notes, India has moved away from terms like “cripple” \n\n\nor “lame” in favor of “visually impaired” (and other person-first terms). This linguistic \nshift is part of a broader effort to dignify disability in public discourse. \nIdentity and Advocacy \n• \nCommunity mobilization: Government-run blind schools and institutions helped launch \na rights movement among India’s visually impaired. Scholars note that such schools \ninitiated the politicization of the visually challenged and spurred self-advocacy. In the \n1990s, activists (such as Javed Abidi) formed groups like the Disability Rights Group, \norganized vigils and hunger strikes, and lobbied for the 1995 Act. More recently, blind \nindividuals have protested discrimination directly (e.g. in 2006 Maharashtra police \nbrutally attacked a group of visually impaired men rallying against government \nexclusion). \n• \nIdentity politics: Blind people navigate both unity and difference within the broader \ndisability movement. On one hand, collective labels (e.g. “visually impaired”) have \nenabled advocacy for shared accommodations and policies. On the other hand, experts \nwarn against assuming all blind people have the same experience or opinions. For \nexample, a policy issue that helps the blind (like a tax concession) might not help others, \nand vice versa. Internal debates continue about whether grouping all visually impaired \ninto one political category helps or imposes rigid identities. \n• \nIntersections: Visually impaired persons also face layers of marginalization (gender, \nclass, caste). Some rights activists caution that movements often reflect urban, middle-\nclass blind voices, while rural or intersectional concerns may be overlooked. The \nstruggle for equal rights is entangled with other social identities, meaning that a Dalit \nblind person’s politics may differ from those of a sighted Dalit or a wealthy blind \nurbanite. Understanding these differences is seen as essential to building an inclusive \nvision of disability rights. \n",
