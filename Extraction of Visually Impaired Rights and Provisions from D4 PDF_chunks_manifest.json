Warning pavers (300×300 mm tiles with \nraised blister domes) are installed at the edges of ramps, staircases and hazards to alert \npersons with visual impairments of approaching danger. \n• \nRamps: Ramps should have slip-resistant surfaces and be well illuminated. Tactile \nwarning blocks must be placed at the top and bottom of each ramp (within 300–600 \nmm of the ramp ends) to warn visually impaired users. Ramps at buildings with \nlimited space may use L-shaped or switchback designs. \n• \nStairs: All stair edges must be clearly visible. Step edges should have a 50-mm wide \nband of high-contrast color (paint or tape) running the full width of each step, so \nthat people with low vision can easily distinguish tread depth and riser height. Stairs \nmust have warning tactile pavers (300 mm before and after each flight) to indicate the \nbeginning and end of steps. Uniform riser heights (max 150 mm) and treads (min 300 \nmm) are required. Checklists emphasize that “each step edge [should be] visually \nhighlighted” and that handrails be provided on both sides of every flight. \n• \nHandrails and Floor-Level Indicators: Continuous handrails are required on both \nsides of ramps and stairs. Handrails should be circular (38–40 mm diameter) and \nmounted at two heights (760 mm and 900 mm above the floor). In multi-storey \nbuildings, tactile markers (e.g. raised dots) are placed on the handrail ends to indicate \nthe floor level: one dot for first floor, two for second, etc., to help a visually impaired \nperson determine location. \n• \nElevators (Lifts): Elevators must be fully accessible. Control panels inside lifts \nshould have Braille labels and raised letters on high-contrast backgrounds, so \nbuttons can be identified by touch. Elevator doors should include vision panels at two \nlevels (approximately 800 mm and 1500 mm above floor) so a person can see into/out \nof the car. Audio announcements of door opening/closing and floor levels must be \nprovided for blind users. The interior of the car should minimize reflective surfaces \n(to avoid glare and confusion) and have a slip-resistant floor with no more than 10 \nmm gap at the doorway. Mirrors (if any) must be set at least 900 mm above the floor \n“to avoid confusing people with visual impairments”. (Emergency communication \nsystems are also equipped with induction loops for the hearing impaired.) \n• \nDoors and Entrances: Entrances and doors should be easy to detect. Vision panels \nare required on doors between 800–1500 mm height, so a person can see if someone \nis on the other side. Doors must be color-contrasted against the wall (e.g. use a \nbright door against a light wall) to make them visible. Heavy or hard-to-operate doors \nare not allowed; ease of opening is emphasized (no more than 22 N force). Recessed \nor thin rubber floor mats or tactile strips should be placed at entrances to allow a \nvisually impaired person to detect the doorway by foot. Accessible toilet doors are \ndesigned to swing outward (or slide) to leave enough space for assistance if needed. \n• \nCorridors and Floor Surfaces: Corridors must be wide and well lit, with clear lines \nof sight to aid orientation. A strong color contrast is recommended between the floor \nand walls (and between walls and ceiling) to help people with low vision stay \n\n\noriented. One or more thick strips of bright color (e.g. yellow or orange) on the \ncorridor floor can serve as a directional guide for the visually impaired. The floor \nfinish itself should be uniform in shade (no busy patterns) to avoid confusion. Matt, \nanti-skid flooring is preferred; not only does it prevent slipping, it also provides a \nsubtle tactile pattern underfoot that can aid navigation for those with vision loss. \nCorridors must be kept free of low-hanging obstacles (nothing protruding more than \n100 mm) and maintain a minimum clear width (≥1500 mm) with turning spaces, so \nthat guidance cues are unobstructed. \n• \nSwitches and Controls: Switchboards, controls and outlets should be visibly \ndistinguishable. Light switches and fuse boxes must be outlined or painted in a \ncontrasting color from the wall, making them stand out for someone with low vision. \nSwitches should also have tactile markers: for example, a raised fan icon on the fan \nswitch and a lightbulb icon on the light switch, so the switch’s function can be felt. \n(All controls should be mounted between 400–1100 mm above floor to accommodate \nseated or shorter users.) \n• \nToilet Facilities: Restroom facilities must include visual cues and accessibility \nfeatures. Signs for general (universal) toilets should use bold, high-contrast \npictograms. For visually impaired users, each sign must be on a rigid plate with \nraised pictograms and Braille or embossed lettering (e.g. male symbol in triangle, \nfemale in circle, with Braille text). These signs are mounted beside each door at about \n1400–1600 mm height for easy reach. Tactile warning pavers or textured mats should \nbe installed 300 mm before and after toilet entrances to signal the doorway location. \nThe toilet seat (WC) and adjacent wall surfaces should use contrasting colors so the \nfixtures stand out for low-vision users. All toilet rooms are equipped with visual fire \nalarms and emergency pull-switches (one near floor and one at about 900 mm height \nby the commode) that trigger an alarm. At least one urinal or washbasin in public \ntoilets must have a tactile warning paver nearby to help a blind person locate it. \n• \nSignage and Wayfinding: Signage throughout buildings must be designed for tactile \nreading and high visibility. Every permanent sign (room numbers, directional signs, \nemergency exit maps, etc.) should use sans-serif fonts, large text and strong color \ncontrast, and should include Braille beneath the text. In particular, accessible toilet \nsigns are standardized: a navy-blue plate with raised white letters (25 mm high) and 1 \nmm thick border, plus Braille directly below the text. Signs for elevators, stairwells \nand exits likewise must have raised letters and Braille on contrasting backgrounds. \nMaps and building directories should, whenever possible, incorporate a tactile map \noverlay or be available with audio guidance so that blind visitors can orient \nthemselves. In multi-storey buildings, it is recommended that each floor’s elevator \nand stairwell signage be color-coded and that stairwell walls have signs at landings \nindicating the current floor (aiding wayfinding in darkness or low vision). \n• \nLighting: Adequate, uniform lighting is vital for persons with low vision. All indoor \nactivity areas should be brightly lit (250–300 lux recommended) to facilitate reading \nand navigation. Corridors and stairwells should have a minimum of 100 lux uniform \nillumination. Light fixtures should have shades or covers (no bare bulbs) to reduce \nglare and avoid flicker, creating a steady visual environment. \n• \nCommunication and Information Access: All information must be made accessible \nin multiple formats. Facilities should provide building information online (adhering to \nweb accessibility standards) and display schematic maps with clear pictograms for \neach service area. Printed documents (notices, schedules, menus, tickets, etc.) must be \navailable in Braille, large-print, audio-recorded or simple-language versions, in \nHindi, English and any relevant local language. Electronic resources (websites, PDFs, \n\n\nmobile apps) should be easily shared (e.g. via email or mobile devices) and support \nassistive technologies. Where forms or applications must be completed, users should \nbe able to fill them electronically with accessible software, and staff assistance should \nbe offered when needed. Personnel should be trained in basic sign language and visual \ncommunication; disability rooms and booths should be equipped with assistive \ndevices such as induction loops, audio orientation tools, and captioned video \ndisplays. Staff must also be prepared to describe visual information verbally. Special \ncare must be taken with lighting: areas used by visually impaired persons should have \nuniform, non-glare lighting and no flicker, so that low vision or hearing-impaired \nindividuals are not disoriented by bright spots or flashing lights. Finally, an accessible \nfeedback or grievance process should exist so that any person with a disability can \nlodge complaints or suggestions in an accommodating manner. \n• \nSports and Recreation Facilities: All sports venues and related buildings must \ninclude features for blind athletes and spectators. Competitions should provide audio \ndescriptions of the action for visually impaired sports persons. Orientation materials \n(maps of the stadium or complex) should be provided in both visual and tactile \nformats, and downloadable wayfinding apps should include audio guidance. \nInformation about events, rules or results must be available in Braille: for example, \ncompetition booklets and score sheets should be provided in Braille for blind athletes. \nScoreboards and announcement systems are required to include audio output as well \nas visual displays, so that a blind spectator can follow the score. Medal ceremonies \nand podiums must be fully accessible: podiums should have ramps or steps with \nhandrails and tactile indicators, and audio announcements should accompany any on-\nscreen graphics. Locker rooms and equipment areas should have tactile or large-\nprint signage: locker numbers must be embossed and supplemented with Braille, and \nbanks of lockers should include some orientation system (e.g. tactile floor paths or \nlandmarks). Surfaces in sports halls should avoid gloss or glare (use matte finishes \nand clear color contrast) to help all athletes, including those with low vision, \ndistinguish areas and equipment. Finally, all accessible sports complexes are required \nby government mandate to meet these standards, ensuring that visually impaired \nathletes have equal access to training and competition facilities. \nSources: Government of India accessibility guidelines for persons with disabilities (compiled \nfrom the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act notifications and the Accessible Sports \nComplex Guidelines). \n \n",
