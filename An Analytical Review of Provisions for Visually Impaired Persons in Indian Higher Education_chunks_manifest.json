The document explicitly lists \na variety of required formats: Braille, audio, enlarged print, and digital formats that are \ncompatible with screen reading software. It also includes a broader category of \"other \ntactile and sensory systems,\" acknowledging the diverse technologies and methods \nused.1 \n• \nOrientation and Mobility (O&M): A critical need for assistance with orientation \n(understanding one's position in an environment) and mobility (navigating that \nenvironment safely and independently) is specified. This acknowledges that navigating a \nlarge and unfamiliar university campus presents significant challenges.1 The technical \nstandards for tactile pathways and GPS mapping in later chapters are a direct response \nto this identified need. \n• \nConceptual Development: The guidelines recognize that students with visual \nimpairments, particularly those with congenital blindness, may require support in \nconcept development. This is a nuanced acknowledgement that incidental learning, \nwhich often occurs visually, may be limited, and formal instruction may be needed to \nbuild a strong foundation for abstract academic concepts.1 \n• \nPsycho-Social and Emotional Support: The document mandates that HEIs recognize \nand provide for the potential need for emotional-behavioral and psycho-social support. \nThis addresses the holistic well-being of the student, acknowledging that adapting to a \nhigher education environment can present unique social and emotional challenges.1 \n• \nInfrastructure and ICT Assistance: A general need for assistance in the use of both \nphysical campus infrastructure and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is \nlisted. This establishes the basis for providing hands-on training and support for \nnavigating buildings and using university portals, software, and other digital tools.1 \n• \nMedical Needs: The guidelines also include the possibility of frequent therapy or \nmedication as a specific need, ensuring that the institution's support systems are \nprepared to accommodate health-related requirements.1",

This \nframework mandates that HEIs provide structured training in areas that are prerequisites for \nacademic success and independent living. \nThis approach demonstrates a sophisticated understanding that true access is not achieved by \nsimply placing a student in a classroom. It requires equipping the student with the specific tools \nand skills to engage with the curriculum on an equal basis. By mandating this plus-curriculum, \nthe UGC effectively redefines the scope of an HEI's duty of care, compelling them to establish \nresource centers and hire specialized personnel, such as O&M instructors and Braille experts, \nto deliver this essential training. \nThe specific components of the Plus-Curriculum include 1: \n• \nBraille Literacy: Formal instruction in both Braille Reading and Braille Writing. \n• \nOrientation & Mobility (O&M): Professional training in O&M techniques for navigating \nthe campus and community. \n• \nSensory and Daily Living Skills: This includes training in Independent Living Skills and \nSensory Training, which focuses on the efficient use of hearing, touch, and other \nsenses. For students with low vision, this also includes training in the use of optical \ndevices. \n• \nSpecialized Academic Tools: Instruction in the use of non-visual mathematical \ndevices, specifically the Taylor's Frame & Abacus. \n• \nCompensatory Skills: Development of a range of skills necessary for accessing the \ncore curriculum, such as concept development, organizational and study skills, the \ninterpretation of tactile graphics, and the effective use of audio materials. \n• \nAssistive Technology (AT): Comprehensive training in the use of relevant assistive \ntechnologies.",

This requires \nexamination departments to move beyond logistics and engage in the pedagogical redesign of \nassessments to create equivalent, non-visual evaluation methods. \n•",

    "text": "UGC Provisions: The guidelines incorporate the provisions of UGC Notification F.No. 6-\n2/2013 (SCT), which mandate the following 1: \n\n\no \nMode of Examination: Students with benchmark disabilities must be given the option \nto take examinations in their preferred format, including Braille, on a computer, or in \nlarge print. \no \nAssistive Devices: Candidates must be permitted to use their standard assistive \ndevices in the examination hall. For students with visual impairments, this includes \ntools like the tailor frame, Braille slate, abacus, geometry kit, and Braille measuring \ntape. \no \nAlternate Question Design: This is a critical pedagogical requirement. For questions \nthat rely on visual inputs, such as interpreting a graph, chart, or image, the examining \nbody must provide alternate questions that assess the same underlying skill or \nknowledge without relying on vision. \no \nOpen Book Exams: In the context of an open book examination, the required reading \nmaterials must be provided to the student in an accessible format, such as Braille or an \ne-text document on a computer equipped with suitable screen reading software. \n• \nFlexibility in Digital Assessment: The guidelines also look towards modern \nassessment methods, promoting flexibility in digital exams. This includes allowing \nstudents to personalize the view of questions (e.g., changing font type, size, or colors) \nand providing built-in text-to-speech software to read questions aloud, a feature that \nbenefits students with vision disabilities as well as those with learning disabilities like \ndyslexia.1",
